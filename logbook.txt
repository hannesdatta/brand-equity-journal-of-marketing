- Availability of brands over time / cut-off (or: SUR with unequal equation length, still, dummies may not be identified well (e.g., attraction decreases just because a new brand enters the market)
--> we decide to model only the longest consecutive stretch of observations for each brand, given that we have at least four years of data
- What are attribute variables used for at this stage?

27 January 2016
- what are the exact variable names that should go into the model

	 brand_name 			used as brand_id
	 Brand_ID 				(column needed to "carry along" in my code?)
	 
	 act_pr_bt 				  orig paper
	 reg_pr_bt     			                  		1)      --> regular price has to be in there for sure
	 pi_bt 					? 						2)   a) --> this for first round; reg. and price index
	 newprdum_bt      
	 fd_bt 					? 
	 pi_unsup_bt 			?							 b)  
	 pi_sup_bt    			?							 b)
	 fd_wo_bt   			?						     b)
	 promo_bt 				? orig paper
	 
	 pct_store_skus 								3)      --> take this as %-SKUs in category are of our brand
	 distrwidth_bt 			? 
	 LineLength_bt			x
	 distrdepth_bt 			?
	 advertising_bt			x                       4)  2nd round
	 adv_stock				  orig paper                preliminary
	 
	 
	 
	 ATTRIBUTES				(I need to clarify again which are the columns to take into account.
							(- Have we already dropped one of the attribute columns?)
							(- Which columns make up one attribute?)
							(- Maybe consider relabeling these columns)
	 
	 packet_bt 
	 liquid_bt  
	 granul_bt 
	 otherfrm_bt 
	 aspartame_bt 
	 sucralose_bt
	 agave_bt 
	 saccharin_bt 
	 othersugar_typ_bt 
	 
	 --> All possibilities are there.
	 --> I get the look-up tables
	 
	 
- Calculation of marketing elasticities:
  beta * X * (1- share)
  
  where share = avg. market share of a brand
  X = AVERAGE marketing of (a) that brand, (b) across all brands
  
  Question: Which marketing mix levels to use? (a) or (b) or ...?
  
  --> Kusum: do option (a)
  
  --> Standardize intercepts
  --> estimate it for every year, drop alphas
  
- Suggestion for an updated Table 4 to reflect our new model:

Columns: Marketing Mix Parameter | Weighted Elasticity | Median Elasticity |  | % brands < 0 | % brands > 0

Table notes: Meta-analytic Z | Significance of Meta-analytic Z.  Weights equal to the elasticities' inverse standard error.


- Are more data sets available already?
- Second stage: Correlation with BAV; could you point me to the data?      KUSUM WILL PROVIDE THE DATA
- Any mean-centering to be used? Currently I do not center any variables.  NO
- Notes: The model document has been updated to reflect our discussion from 26 January 2016.
- Suggestion for next steps:
	o implement copulas
	o calculate elasticities
	o develop maximum likelihood estimator to enable HLM-type models and estimation of advertising carry-over
	o calculate VIFs (do we care much?) --> always check (but, if signs are ok... we are fine)


- Elasticities
- Face validity
